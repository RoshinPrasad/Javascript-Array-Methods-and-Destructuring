1.Currying
	Currying is when you break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take only one argument.
	Currying provides a way for working with functions that take multiple arguments, and using them in frameworks where functions might take only one argument.

2.DOM
	With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
	The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents.
	The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

		*Core DOM - standard model for all document types
		*XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
		*HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
	In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.
 	
	DOM methods:
		HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).
		HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.

#.BOM
                  The Browser Object Model (BOM)
                   (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser.

3.Scope
                 Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.

                 JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

                    Block scope
                    Function scope
                    Global scope 
4.Loops
                Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
                
5.Conditions
                
              In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:-

                           Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
                           Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
                           Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
                           Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

6.Objects
                In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

                             Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
                             Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
                             Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
                             Dates are always objects
                             Maths are always objects
                             Regular expressions are always objects
                             Arrays are always objects
                             Functions are always objects
                             Objects are always objects
                             All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

                                 # With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.

                                  There are different ways to create new objects:

                                  Create a single object, using an object literal.
                                  Create a single object, with the keyword new.
                                  Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
                                  Create an object using Object.create()

7.this
                  this keyword refers to an object.
               
                     In an object method, this refers to the object.
                        Alone, this refers to the global object.
                        In a function, this refers to the global object.
                        In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
                        In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
                        Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

8.Window
                  The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.

                   All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
                  Global variables are properties of the window object.
                  Global functions are methods of the window object.
                  Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:

                 
                  Some other methods:

                  window.open() - open a new window
                  window.close() - close the current window
                  window.moveTo() - move the current window
                  window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

9.== & ===
                  The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands   before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.  
                   loose equality (==) and strict equality operators (===).

10.SetInterval
                   setInterval() The setInterval() method, offered on the Window and Worker interfaces, repeatedly calls a function or executes a code  snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call. This method returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval, so you                    can remove it later by calling clearInterval() .

11.Javascript Engine
                   A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. 
                        (( JavaScript is not understandable by computer but the only browser understands JavaScript. So, we need a program to convert      our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language. A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes      JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language.))

12.Call Stack
                  The call stack is used by JavaScript to keep track of multiple function calls.
                  Call Stack in JavaScript is a type of data structure that maintains the tracks of invoked and executed functions.

13.Generator
                  A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword                   rather than return. 
                 To create a generator, you need to first define a generator function with function* symbol. 

14.Clean Code
                 Clean code is clear, understandable, and maintainable.
                 Clean code can be defined as the code written in such a manner that is self-explanatory, easy to understand by humans and easy to      change.

15.Bind
                 With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.
                 It allows you to create a new function from an existing function, change the new function's this context, and provide any arguments   you want the new function to be called with.

16.JSON (JavaScript Object Notation )
                 JSON is a format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

17.JQUERY  $()
                 jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.

18.EXECUTION CONTEXT
                 The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution

19.IndexOf
                 The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string. The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is      not found.
20.FILTER
                 The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
